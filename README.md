# public-music-queue
Red Spark Project

Music discovery today happens in algorithmic bubbles or private friend groups, limiting exposure to new genres and artists. Existing social music features like Spotify Jam require invitations and stay within closed circles. We want to break down these barriers by creating one completely open music queue where anyone can contribute songs and discover music through genuine community curation, rather than just algorithms. This transforms music listening from an isolated activity into a shared, spontaneous, and possibly chaotic experience where strangers can listen to new music together.
